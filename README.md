# Portfolio-React

This is my personal portfolio, but refactored to work within the React framework. In the portfolio one will find biographical information, a resume, work samples, and contact information. 
In addition to React, it uses Bootstrap, react-router-dom, and react-scripts.

#Deployment
Once completed, this app wil be deployed via netlify. A link to view the deployed application will replace this line (line 7).

# Portfolio-React

This is my personal portfolio, but refactored to work within the React framework. In the portfolio one will find biographical information, a resume, work samples, and contact information. 
In addition to React, it uses Bootstrap, react-router-dom, and react-scripts.

#Attention Trilogy Grader: 
Please note that I do not have any recent photos of myself (as I do not like being photographed). I am aware that I will need to get some decent headshots taken, and will replace the placeholder image with a headshot once I have one. 

#Deployment
Once completed, this app wil be deployed via netlify. A link to view the deployed application will replace this line (line 7).
